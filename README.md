## Overview
​
## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

## My process
​
### What I learned
​
I learned a great deal about how to set up through Heroku and using a PORT const that allows both local port and a port to link to Heroku. I think a lot of this is just learning the boilerplate functions that come with express/path. 
​

### Useful resources

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - This is the website for Node.js, which is necassary for making the app work.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - This is the home page for Express.js to learn how to download and use the program.
